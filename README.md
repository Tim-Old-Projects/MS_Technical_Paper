This is my Applied Economics and Statistics Technical Paper.  It uses economics, visualization, and data analysis to illustrate a profit mazimizing ticket pricing strategy for Division 1 Men's Basketball Games. The paper was written with Clemson University Men's Basketball in mind, but the data is public and the methodology could be repeated for other college or professional sports events.
